SUMMARY
A game of battleships against the computer!

TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Built using React.JS and Redux.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
* replace intricate javascript with lodash functions where possible.
* make a notification to show the computer guessing, what they guessed, if it was successful or not, when it is the players go etc...
* intercept a page refresh to make sure the user doesn't lose their game progress.
* i like the idea of the theme styling to look like it has been drawn with a pencil. Investigate the posibility of this (e.g. https://balsamiq.com/)

KNOWN BUGS
* boards take up too much height at desktop widths
* check how to horizontally center the playerBoard and computerBoard components using flexbox on boardContainer.
